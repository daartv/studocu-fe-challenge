## Introduction

Hello! This is my attempt at the challenge, should be fairly simple,clone or download the repo, run `yarn install` or alternatively `npm install` to install necessary dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Considerations
I spent about 5 hours in total with the challenge, I know you didn't really give me a time constriction, but I found it in the form of other challenges and holiday prepping! Because of this I only made one concession: Some styling and CSS.

I did focus on Redux which I got the impression was an important part of the stack at the company and better yet, modern implementations through hooks! I also focused on responsiveness, you can see that the view on mobile is more focused and helpful.

I'm really looking forward to discussing my challenge with you and maybe even get the approval of Dusty and the Studocat!
